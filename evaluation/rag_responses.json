    "answer": "The attention mechanism in the Transformer model works by allowing each position in the input sequence to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This is done through multi-head attention, which computes a weighted sum of value vectors based on similarity scores between queries and keys. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence depending on the task at hand. In the encoder, self-attention layers allow each position in the encoder to attend to all positions in the previous layer. In the decoder, multi-head attention is used in three different ways: encoder-decoder attention, self-attention, and multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. The attention mechanism helps the model to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sequence, making it well-suited for tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.",

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2).

    "answer": "Residual connections are a type of connection in neural networks that allow the output of one layer to be passed directly to an input of another layer, without any further processing. This is done by adding a shortcut path between the two layers, which essentially bypasses some of the intermediate layers.\n\nResidual connections are important in deep networks because they help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when gradients become too small during backpropagation and can no longer be effectively used to update the network's weights. By allowing the output of one layer to be passed directly to an input of another layer, residual connections ensure that the gradients remain large enough to allow for efficient optimization of the network.\n\nResidual connections also help to improve the accuracy of deep networks by allowing them to learn more complex features and patterns from the input data. This is because the shortcut paths in the residual connections effectively allow the network to learn from both the shallow and deep layers, rather than just relying on one or the other.\n\nOverall, residual connections are an important tool for training deeper and more complex neural networks, as they help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem and improve the accuracy of the network's predictions.",

If one\nhypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptoti-\ncally approximate complicated functions2, then it is equiv-\nalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approxi-\nmate the residual functions, i.e.,H(x)\u0000x(assuming that\nthe input and output are of the same dimensions). So\nrather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we\nexplicitly let these layers approximate a residual function\nF(x) :=H(x)\u0000x. The original function thus becomes\nF(x)+x.
